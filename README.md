This is a from-scratch C++ implementation of a few data analysis and machine learning algorithms. Tested on the MNIST handwriting public data set.

The following algorithms where implemented from scratch without any ML libraries to support them:
1. K-means
2. K-Nearest-Neighbors
3. Standard Neural Network


The top level include, lib, and src folders contain all the data handling, and each algorithm has its own folder.

While this was written to not use any exisitng ML libraries, I definitely didn't re-invent the wheel on my own. I had to learn a lot from online sources, textbooks and videos to complete this project, and in the end I still struggled to fully comprehend the necessity of everything that went in to it. ML is an extremely deep and complicated topic. For example, I still don't believe I have a complete understanding of how the backpropogation unwrapping works, even if I can mostly understand the calculus.

Similar, or exactly the same, effects as this project can be accomplished with better optimized libraries like Tenserflow. Machine Learning is a form of applied mathematics, and has been mostly "solved" on the level of this project.
