This is a from-scratch C++ implementation of a few data analysis and machine learning algorithms. Tested on the MNIST handwriting public data set.

The following algorithms where implemented from scratch without any ML libraries to support them:
1. K-means
2. K-Nearest-Neighbors
3. Standard Neural Network


The top level include, lib, and src folders contain all the data handling, and each algorithm has its own folder.
